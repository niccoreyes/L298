I've got modified libraries (pololu = semi modified) for each in my head :DD

L298 direct
1 motor channel= 2 PWM pins as DIR at the same time (because of direct lines)
direct input on IN1 IN2 IN3 IN4

L298 arduino motor driver
(because of logic gates)
1 motor channel = 1 PWM, 1 DIR (digital) pin, 1 BRAKES (digital)
on one channel
DIRA:
  if HIGH, it goes forward
  if LOW, it goes reverse
  goes through logic gates to input whatever on IN1 IN2 IN3 IN4
PWM:
  speed control
  if 0
       coasting //turns motor off
BRAKES:
  if HIGH, it sets IN1 and IN2 to HIGH

POLOLU DualVNH5019MotorShield
(idk)
1 motor channel = 1 PWM, 2 DIR PIN (digital)
